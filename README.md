# My LangChain Playground
This repo consists of some dummy examples I've wanted to create in order to see LangChain in action, as well as solidificate some knowledge I've got throughout some good time of work experience. Feel free to take a look at each file and get better at LangChain as well!

By the way, I've got a lot of knowledge from NVidia DLI courses. You can check it out [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/)

### Requirements
- In order to run the files on `/src` folder, you must set up a Groq API Key on the `.env` file. You can get one [here](https://console.groq.com/keys)
- Also, you must run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To run any isolated file, you should do it like that:
```bash
python -m src.<folder>.<file_without_.py>
```
